          <h3>Online Jewellery Store</h3>
          <hr style={{ color: 'blue' }}></hr>
          <p>DazzleLane.com began in 2008 with the simple motto of democratising jewellery. And today, after 13 glorious years, it has come to be recognised as one of the top 20 e-commerce portals in India. Steadily growing from strength to strength since inception, DazzleLane has also established 165 stores across the length and breadth of India.
            Since July 2016, we joined forces with India’s most desired and largest jewellery brand, Tanishq, through a strategic investment made by Titan Company in DazzleLane. This takes us another step closer to achieving our shared mission - to make beautiful jewellery accessible to everyone.</p>

            Our app is designed to bridge the vast gap between the virtual and the physical world. This has been attained with the help of the Virtual Try-on feature that permits the users to virtually put on 1000s of earrings to see just how they look when placed on the ears.


            With over 100 thousand downloads, the DazzleLane app has emerged to be one of the most liked applications in the jewellery circuit.</p>
